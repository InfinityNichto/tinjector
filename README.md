# tinjector!
## "whats up with the name?"
tinjector is short for terraria injector, i just used terraria cause thats the game i play the most :P
---
currently uses ptrace to control target process. current main focus would be to create a working hooking mechanism on il2cpp games

## TODO:
- find out a way on how to do hooks
- move to cpp (and use cmake)
- try not using ptrace...? (no way)
